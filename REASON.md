# Inspiration & Market Reasoning
- **Problem:** Developers and designers often struggle to find consistent, high-quality, up-to-date cryptocurrency icons in multiple formats (SVG, PNG, JPG).
- **Solution:** An open-source, automated hub pulling directly from CoinGecko and TradingView that provides SVGs and on-the-fly PNG/JPG conversion via the browser.
- **Why this works:** It is similar to Flaticon but specialized for Crypto. By leveraging GitHub Pages and CDN, hosting costs are zero, and availability is high.
